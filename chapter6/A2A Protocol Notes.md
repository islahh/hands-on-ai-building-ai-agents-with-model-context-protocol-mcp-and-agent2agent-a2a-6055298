## "What is A2A?":

Challenges in Multi-Agent Systems: Multi-agent systems involve multiple agents collaborating to execute business functions, which can lead to integration complexity as the number of agents grows.
Purpose of A2A Protocol: The A2A protocol addresses these challenges by providing a common open standard for agent-to-agent communications, allowing agents to communicate seamlessly.
Features of A2A: A2A supports agent discovery, task-based workflows, and ensures security and privacy, making it suitable for communication across organizational boundaries.

## "Architecture of A2A":

Main Actors in A2A: The A2A setup includes three main actors: the A2A user (human or client program), the A2A client agent (initiates communication), and the A2A server agent (executes requests and returns responses).
Client-Server Interaction: The A2A client agent connects to the A2A server agent using the A2A protocol, initiating connections, getting agent listings, and executing tasks.
Integration with MCP: Both A2A client and server agents can independently use MCP servers for tools, prompts, and resources, and they can share MCP servers if needed.
Flexibility in Agent Roles: An agent can act as both a client and a server for different actions, allowing for complex interactions and integrations within a multi-agent system.

## "A2A communication elements":

Agent Card: A JSON-based metadata document describing an agent's configurations and capabilities, including identity, endpoint, version, skills, and modalities.
Task: The unit of work requested by an A2A client, identified by a unique task ID, which can be synchronous or asynchronous.
Message: A single unit of communication between an A2A client and server, identified by a message ID and can include various data types like TextPart, FilePart, and DataPart.
Artifact: The output generated by the A2A server, such as answers, documents, images, or audio files, which can be sent back to the client using messages.

These elements are essential for understanding how A2A communication works and how tasks are managed and executed within the protocol.

## "A2A protocols":

Request-Response: The A2A client sends a request, and the server responds with a working status and updates until the task is complete.
Streaming with Server-Sent Events: The server streams status updates or artifacts to the client without additional requests, continuing until the task is complete.
Push Notifications: Used for asynchronous communication, the client sends a request with a callback URL, and the server sends updates and final artifacts to this URL, terminating the connection after each update.

## "A2A discovery strategies"
Agent Discovery: Agents can discover each other using well-known URIs or curated registries.
Well-Known URIs: Agents are deployed with a known URI, similar to a website, allowing clients to retrieve the Agent Card and discover details about the agent.
Curated Registries: A central registry where all A2A agents are published, providing search functions to filter agents based on capabilities and enabling dynamic discovery and integration during runtime.

## A2A client and server communication flow
Agent Card: The A2A server registry contains the Agent Card, which includes the agent's capabilities and URL.
Client-Server Communication: The A2A client uses the registry URL to fetch the Agent Card and establish a connection with the A2A server.
Task Execution: The A2A server interface invokes the Agent Executor, which communicates with the AI Agent to execute tasks and returns the results to the client.
